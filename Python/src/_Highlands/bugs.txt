updated 26/6  22:30

1(FIXED). checkboxes must not be empty.  This can happen if we check a box and then uncheck.
perhaps use: $('#txt').val($("input[type=checkbox]:checked").length)
this can happen with text fields as well

2(FIXED). The title line of some of the pie charts are chopped on the left  ( about 4 characters).


3(FIXED). In Charts tab, similar to showing the numberic scores when the cursor is on the bar plots, can you 
show the name of the person who did the response, when the cursor is on the name of the client (the Y axis) 
or just add this to the info that is shown when hovering over the bar plots.

4(FIXED).  Q35, Thinking like your client, can you make it 3 lines, that scroll, so that people can put quite a 
bit ot text in there.  
Maybe have a "large text" answer type, incase we want more like this.

4ai(FIXED). On Android devices the textarea doesn't display properly in portrait mode, but it worls in landscape mode.  Seems to be an Android bug.  
Maybe there is a workaround?

5(NOT FIXED).  On the Pie charts, can you show the actual count if the cursor is hovered over that segment of the pie
the c3.js library has a bug - the tooltips don't work for pie charts

6(FIXED). On Charts, I had two companies before I submitted a new profile, and did another profile for one of these companies. 
When I went to the Charts tab, it showed two company plots,  was expecting to see one of the companies to be plotted twice (one per submision).

7(FIXED).  I got this error, but not been able to reproduce it just after talking with you today..

7(Can't reproduce).  I have intiailized the DB and before I filled in a profile I went to the Chart tab - nothing was displayed.  
I did see this python error

8(FIXED).  Can you add a separate html client file that has the tabs for the Chart and Pie Charts and remove the tabs 
from the Client.html file

9(FIXED). Copyright text needs the final character a "  to be removed

10(Can't reproduce).  I completed 3 assessments but only 1 shows on the charts view.  I did see this error

26/6(Can't reproduce) More on the above.  I have just entered 2 assessment for the same company, with the same section1 details. The 2nd assessment is
not stored in MySQL (spotted by looking at the charts). here is the error

NEW
11(FIXED).  Q33 Where is your client's business...  There is extra text after the question text.  
ie 33. Where is your client's business dynamic vs the market dynamic?
Please click the box that best shows the market position of your client. (X-axis = Market Growth, Y-axis = Client Revenue Growth),Where is your client?,Very Strong,Flat,Major Decline,0,Flat,Very Strong
The question ends at the ")", the "," onwards has been added.

(FIXED)Error 6 remains.  It appears to be when a 2nd entry is made using the same company name and same section 1 info.
Looking at the value for the bars, it looks like the two entries for the same company are added together on the one bar.
Also, if you have a blank section1 (after asking to submit a new profile), and enter the same section 1 and 2 as the previous
submission, the Mqsql insert happens.  Maybe the GUID is not getting changed, when the section 1 is represented, filled in
when asking to submit another assessment?


12(FIXED) Can you add the name of the submitter when you hover over the plots (you see the values for the 3 bars
plus the name of the company.

13(FIXED)  On the "client master" form, when asking to submit another assessment, it takes you back to section 1 which is blank -
it should retain the info from the first assessment.


14(Can't reproduce).  I loaded some more assessments - one for Tesco and then one for Waitrose.  The Waitrose one did not show up on the charts
but this error did.

Could this be due to the GUID being resused as a result of pre-populating the section 1 when you ask to do another survey?

15(FIXED).  On the pie charts the summ of responses using the tooltips is 10, but there are only 4 plots on the charts?
